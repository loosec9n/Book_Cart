This e-commerce project is purely for learning the way around Golang.
Developing and improving the logical approach, learning new technologies and implementing. 

Key Features:

GOlang as backend,
PostgreSQL as the relational database for storing sophisticated data, 
Docker, Docker-Compose toolkit for containerising and making this project platform independent. 
AWS EC2 for hosting the project,
Postman to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.

Please feel free to clone this repos and just run docker compose up.
Make sure you have docker installed in your system.
